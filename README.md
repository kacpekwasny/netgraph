# netgraph

This is a project for ML course at AGH.
The task is to use a Graph Neural Netrwork (GNN) and predict some parameters of a network
like the load on a between two routers.

The idea is to:
- generate multiple networks, then perform routing accurate simulations of traffic loads,
- train GNN on those networs,
- use GNN to predict loads on connections,
